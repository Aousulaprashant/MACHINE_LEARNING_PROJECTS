# Machine Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects repository! This is a collection of all the machine learning projects that I am working on as I learn and grow in this field.

## Overview

In this repository, you will find various machine learning projects, each showcasing different algorithms, techniques, and applications. I aim to continuously improve my skills by implementing different projects and exploring new concepts.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects you can expect to find in this repository:

- **[Rock Mile Prediction]()**:
    - In this project, I aim to predict the time it takes to run a mile over rocky terrain using various machine learning techniques. The prediction is based on features such as terrain type, elevation, weather conditions, runner's past performance, and more. The goal is to create a model that can assist athletes or outdoor enthusiasts in estimating their run time on challenging trails.

- **[2.Diabetes Prediction]()**:
    - The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the likelihood of a person being diabetic based on a set of medical parameters.
    - **[DataSet-Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tUPL2AHegvZs_Kvu-0YHSMPUT4cu-G7C/view?usp=drive_link)**:
- **[3.span_ham_mail_Detection]()**:
    - The primary goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that accurately classifies emails as either spam or ham (non-spam).The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, ensuring its effectiveness in detecting unwanted spam emails.
